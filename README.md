Fuel Auth (for Node.js) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ExactTarget/Fuel-Node-Auth.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ExactTarget/Fuel-Node-Auth)
=============

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/fuel-auth.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/fuel-auth/)

This library allows users to create authentication clients for ExactTarget APIs.

Use our [REST][1] and [SOAP][2] clients to interact with these APIs at a low-level.

This library is compatible with:
- Node.js
  - 0.10
  - 0.12
- io.js

**Node 0.8.x**

As of v2, this library will no longer support node v0.8.x. At the moment (v2 release), this library works with node versions 0.8.x  but the tests will fail due to a dev dependency being incompatible with this node version.

*Please note,* full support for v0.8.x will likely be dropped in the near future.
